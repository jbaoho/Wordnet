# Wordnet

This repository is a project from Princeton's Algorithms course that is uses graph data structures and breadth first search to relate meanings between words. The BFS algorithm finds the most recent common ancestor (SAP - shortest ancestral path) between two words based on their definitions. In the respoisitory there are files to read tests on the code as well as the actual code written in Java within the src folder.
